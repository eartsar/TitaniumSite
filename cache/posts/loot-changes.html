<p>Due to feedback from many members, free loot will now be regulated by a DKP-like system.</p>
<p>An item is considered &quot;Free Loot&quot; if its useable jobs are all undeclared as primary or secondary jobs by all members of the group, with the exception of any listed caveats.</p>
<p>The system will work as follows.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Every member will start with a single point.</li>
<li>Upon starting the event, every member will gain a single point.</li>
<li>When items drop, should they meet the requirements of being &quot;Free Loot&quot;, the member with the highest number of points may choose to take the item or pass it. Should the member pass the item, the choice goes on to the member with the second highest number of points.</li>
<li>In the case of a tie, members will roll against one another.</li>
<li>If the person who acquired the item has the most amount of points, their points will be reduced to tie with the second highest. Otherwise, the member loses a single point.</li>
<li>If all members pass on the item (refuse to spend points), it then becomes &quot;Free Lot&quot; in which all members may roll on the item if they so desire.</li>
</ol>
