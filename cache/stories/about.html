<p>Titanium is a Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn Free Company that attempts to stay up-to-date with relevent end-game content while keeping a relaxed environment for the players. We're busy people who play the game, and so it is important that we maximize our time that we do invest to get the highest return of enjoyment. That is to say, we don't go for doing things first, but rather, in half the time invested.</p>
<p>Titanium currently has <em>three</em> active groups with the following schedules on eastern evening times:</p>
<p>Group A
Leader: Fura Barumaru
M/W</p>
<p>Group B
Leader: Fauxra Barumaru
T/H</p>
<p>Group C
Leader: Panelo Snow
T/H</p>
<p>While we typically do not accept applications unless we are openly recruiting, feel free to contact Fura Barumaru in-game with any inquiries.</p>
