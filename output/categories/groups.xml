Group C is nearly filled, with D already formed. This will bring our member count to 32, with a few non-static members. There are no current plans to expand much more beyond this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two groups were acquiring from the GG free company - a nice group of people who I have been close to for some time. Groups A and B, please welcome our new members warmly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>groups</category><guid>http://www.titanium-ffxiv.com/posts/groups-c-and-d.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2014 17:27:24 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Team B</title><link>http://www.titanium-ffxiv.com/posts/team-b.html</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Titanium will be expanding to accommodate a second team (Team B). The team is fully filled, with all members holding onto a Team B linkpearl. These members will be brought into the FC over the next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team B will be running on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 9:30PM Eastern time. Other times may be scheduled as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team composition is as follows:
Fauxra
Lauli
Kigen
Drakeon
Auluras
Seyo
Kaoru
Hiro&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>groups</category><guid>http://www.titanium-ffxiv.com/posts/team-b.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jan 2014 23:40:12 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
