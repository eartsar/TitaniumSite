Titanium will be expanding to accommodate two new groups (Groups C and D). Group C is nearly filled, with D already formed. This will bring our member count to 32, with a few non-static members. There are no current plans to expand much more beyond this.

These two groups were acquiring from the GG free company - a nice group of people who I have been close to for some time. Groups A and B, please welcome our new members warmly.
