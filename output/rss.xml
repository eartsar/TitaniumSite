&lt;p&gt;An item is considered "Free Loot" if its useable jobs are all undeclared as primary or secondary jobs by all members of the group, with the exception of any listed caveats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system will work as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every member will start with a single point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upon starting the event, every member will gain a single point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When items drop, should they meet the requirements of being "Free Loot", the member with the highest number of points may choose to take the item or pass it. Should the member pass the item, the choice goes on to the member with the second highest number of points.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the case of a tie, members will roll against one another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the person who acquired the item has the most amount of points, their points will be reduced to tie with the second highest. Otherwise, the member loses a single point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If all members pass on the item (refuse to spend points), it then becomes "Free Lot" in which all members may roll on the item if they so desire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information on the system can be found &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://titanium.guildwork.com/_/loot-system"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://www.titanium-ffxiv.com/posts/loot-changes.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2014 02:44:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Recorded Twintania Kill</title><link>http://www.titanium-ffxiv.com/posts/recorded-twintania-kill.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Groups B, C, and D are all getting close to getting their first Twintania kills.

Group C is nearly filled, with D already formed. This will bring our member count to 32, with a few non-static members. There are no current plans to expand much more beyond this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two groups were acquiring from the GG free company - a nice group of people who I have been close to for some time. Groups A and B, please welcome our new members warmly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>groups</category><guid>http://www.titanium-ffxiv.com/posts/groups-c-and-d.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2014 17:27:24 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Twintania on Farm</title><link>http://www.titanium-ffxiv.com/posts/twintania-on-farm.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Group A has now one-shotted Twintania, and we can now declare T5 on farm.

The team is fully filled, with all members holding onto a Team B linkpearl. These members will be brought into the FC over the next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team B will be running on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 9:30PM Eastern time. Other times may be scheduled as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team composition is as follows:
Fauxra
Lauli
Kigen
Drakeon
Auluras
Seyo
Kaoru
Hiro&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>groups</category><guid>http://www.titanium-ffxiv.com/posts/team-b.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jan 2014 23:40:12 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
