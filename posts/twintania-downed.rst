Hi all!

After pushing T5 in coil for the past week, we finally did it - Twintania is dead! Congrats to Potechy and his new Allagan Spear, and Seifur Almasy and his new helmet. Thank you Seifur, Apollo, and Titania for filling in tonight so that we could push for our first win. Hopefully, we'll have more on the way!

There will be no more coil until next week, when we will resume normal scheduling.
